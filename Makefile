# This Makefile provides a 'test' target to run R tests.
#
# Usage:
#   make test          -> Runs all tests using devtools::test()
#   make test R/foo.R  -> Runs a specific test file using testthat::test_file()
#   make test R/foo.R R/bar.R -> Runs multiple specific test files

# .PHONY declares the 'test' target as phony. This tells Make that 'test' is
# not a file that will be created by the rule. This is important to prevent
# conflicts if a file named 'test' ever exists in the directory, and it also
# improves performance slightly as Make won't check for a file named 'test'.
.PHONY: test

# Capture all command-line arguments passed to Make.
# For example, if you run `make test R/file.R`, MAKECMDGOALS will be "test R/file.R".
ARGS := $(MAKECMDGOALS)

# Filter out the target name ('test') from the arguments.
# Whatever remains is treated as the list of files to test.
# If no files are passed, this variable will be empty.
FILES := $(filter-out test,$(ARGS))

# The primary test target.
